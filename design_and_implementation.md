# WebGL-BERTopic: Design and Implementation

## 1. Project Overview

WebGL-BERTopic aims to implement the BERTopic algorithm using WebGL for GPU-accelerated processing in web browsers. This document outlines the design decisions, technical challenges, and implementation strategies for the project.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 BERT Model Adaptation

- Use DistilBERT for a smaller model footprint
- Implement model quantization (8-bit integers) to reduce size
- Utilize TensorFlow.js for model loading and inference

### 2.2 WebGL Implementation

- Use WebGL 2.0 for broader browser support and advanced features
- Implement custom shaders for matrix operations
- Optimize data transfer between CPU and GPU using ping-pong rendering

### 2.3 BERTopic Algorithm

- Modularize algorithm steps for flexible implementation
- Implement document embedding, dimensionality reduction, and clustering
- Adapt c-TF-IDF and class-based TF-IDF for topic representation

## 3. Technical Challenges and Solutions

### 3.1 Memory Management

- Implement document streaming for large collections
- Use Web Workers for background processing
- Employ IndexedDB for client-side storage of intermediate results

### 3.2 UMAP and HDBSCAN

- Implement a WebGL-optimized version of UMAP
- Use a simplified clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means) as an initial alternative to HDBSCAN
- Provide option to offload HDBSCAN to a server for heavy computations

### 3.3 Tokenization and Preprocessing

- Use a lightweight JavaScript tokenizer (e.g., tokenizer from transformers.js)
- Implement caching mechanism for tokenized inputs
- Provide option for server-side preprocessing for large documents

## 4. Performance Optimizations

- Use WebAssembly (Wasm) for compute-intensive tasks not suitable for WebGL
- Implement progressive rendering for real-time feedback during processing
- Optimize shader programs for different GPU architectures

## 5. API Design

```javascript
class WebGLBERTopic {
  constructor(options: BERTopicOptions);
  fit_transform(documents: string[]): Promise<TopicModel>;
  transform(documents: string[]): Promise<TopicAssignments>;
  visualize(): TopicVisualization;
}
```

## 6. Visualization Strategy

- Use Three.js for WebGL-based 3D visualizations
- Implement 2D fallback using Canvas API
- Provide interactive elements (zoom, pan, click-to-explore)

## 7. Testing and Benchmarking

- Use Jest for unit and integration testing
- Implement browser-based benchmarking suite
- Compare performance and results with original Python implementation

## 8. Browser Compatibility

- Target modern browsers with WebGL 2.0 support
- Implement feature detection and graceful degradation
- Provide CPU fallback for devices without WebGL support

## 9. Security and Data Privacy

- Implement client-side encryption for sensitive data
- Use secure WebGL practices (e.g., avoiding readPixels for sensitive data)
- Provide clear documentation on data handling for users

## 10. Development Roadmap

1. Core WebGL infrastructure and BERT integration
2. Basic BERTopic algorithm implementation
3. Performance optimizations and memory management
4. Advanced features (UMAP, interactive visualizations)
5. Comprehensive testing and benchmarking
6. Documentation and API finalization

## 11. Open Challenges

- Efficient implementation of HDBSCAN in WebGL/JavaScript
- Handling very large document collections in browser environment
- Ensuring consistent performance across different devices and GPUs

This document will be continuously updated as the project evolves.
