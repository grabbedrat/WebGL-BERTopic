# AdaptiMark

## Adaptive Visual Bookmark Topography

AdaptiMark is an innovative, WebGL-powered system for organizing and visualizing browser bookmarks. It combines incremental topic modeling with dynamic 3D visualization to create an adaptive, interactive bookmark landscape.

**Note: This project is currently under development and not yet functional.**

## Features

- **Incremental Topic Modeling**: Real-time categorization of bookmarks as they're added or modified.
- **Dynamic 3D Visualization**: Interactive 3D representation of your bookmark topography.
- **Adaptive Clustering**: Responsive organization that evolves with user interactions and new data.
- **Semantic Zooming**: Explore bookmarks at varying levels of topic granularity.
- **WebGL-Accelerated**: Utilizes GPU power for smooth performance and complex visualizations.

## Technical Overview

AdaptiMark leverages cutting-edge web technologies to provide a unique bookmark management experience:

- WebGL Compute Shaders for incremental topic modeling
- GPU-accelerated adaptive layout combining force-directed positioning and topic-based clustering
- Multi-scale representation of bookmarks for semantic zooming
- Optimized WebGL rendering for smooth transitions and interactions
