## Workflow

1. All new tasks start in the **Backlog**.
2. During planning, tasks are moved to **To Do** and assigned.
3. When work begins on a task, it's moved to **In Progress**.
4. Completed tasks are moved to **Review** for team evaluation.
5. After passing review, tasks are moved to **Done**.
6. Regular backlog grooming and board updates maintain project momentum.

This project board structure provides a clear overview of the AdaptiMark development process, from initial setup to launch preparation. It can be adjusted as needed throughout the project lifecycle.
